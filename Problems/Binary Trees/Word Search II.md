## Problem Name: Word Search II
### Difficulty: Hard

#### Thought Process:
Given an mxn board of characters, return ALL words that can be made on the board using adjcent cells.

From each node, we construct words horiz. and vertically.
We are given a 2D array of characters.

Check notes for actual thoughts.

Runtime: 5%
Space: 5%

#### What I learned: 
Regarding my thought process, I focused too much initially on the possible optimizations.

This led to decision paralysis and made me not start coding until after an hour and 15 minutes.
NExt time I'll try the shitty first draft idea and implement a non optimal algoirthm first, and then focus on possible optimizations later, maybe noting them along the way.

However, I did try that here and it still took me an hour and 16 minutes to implement a minimally optimized algorithm.
It yielded a runtime percentile of 5% and a space percentile of 5%, which are both really subpar numbers.

I'll have to experiment with my way of coming up with solutions further and find the most efficient way for me.

This was fun though! Hard problems are a hit or miss but all of them help me refine my thinking process.
