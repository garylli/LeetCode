## Problem Name: Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
### Difficulty: Medium
#### Date Completed: June 28th, 2021.

#### What I learned:
Although this is a problem similar to the one I had just solved, it had some intricacies that I completely ignored simply due to
their comparable nature. Once again I jumped straight into coding and was met with many many issues that made this problem take
almost an hour instead of the 15 minutes it should've.

Next time, I'll be sure to plan out the algorithm more thoroughly before starting with my code.

This time, however, I did jump straight into finding a solution without worrying about optimization, which helped 
speed up my problem solving a lot.

Ended with a ~75 percentile solution in 53 minutes. Will continue trying to improve these times as I try out new ways to think and
approach new problems.
