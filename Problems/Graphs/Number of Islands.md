## Problem Name: Number of Islands
### Difficulty: Medium

#### Time Taken: 1:14:00

#### Thought Process:

#### What I learned: 
I still need to work on my cpp programming structures. My way of implementing the islands was the exact same as the top solution, but
instead of getting anywhere near a 100% runtime, I got a 6% runtime.

This is because I used unordered_map<int, unordered_map<int,int>> instead of simply using a 2d array to store my numbers.

It slowed down my runtime by a LOT.

Note to self: Review data structures and attempt to optimize problems after finishing them.
