#### Thought Process:
My first graph problem! Yay!

So this problem asks us to return a copy of the graph given only a single node and its neighbors. Thus, we simply have to reconstruct the nodes from the adjacency lists.

49:34.33 It took me almost 50 minutes to implement DFS/Djikstra's. Yikes. The real reason why was because I haven't coded in CPP in a while and didn't want to go through the trouble of figuring out a queue so I just used an unordered map. That was quite stupid.

Other than that, it was fairly easy. I just forgot to pass the array by reference which was leading me to incorrect answers when it was actually right.

#### What I learned: 
Review your CPP programming structures.
