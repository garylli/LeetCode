#### Thought Process:
5:47.55 We want to return the minimum number of intervals we need to remove.
Thus, we can probably sort the intervals by interval size and insert in that order. This is because the least amount of overlapping intervals we'd have to remove would be the
n-largest overlapping intervals in the array. However, we run into a problem in tracking which intervals are already inserted.

I'm a bit tired of doing leetcode problems so I'm going to take a break and read some of the javascript guide but I'll come back to this later :).
