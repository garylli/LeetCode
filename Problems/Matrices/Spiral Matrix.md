## Problem Name: Spiral Matrix
### Difficulty: Medium

#### Time Taken: 15:00

#### Thought Process:
Simply replace the items in the matrix with values that are outside the possible set so that the key values are never visited. THen, we can use a counter to track how many we've 
counted and when it reaches the size of the matrix, we can stop and return solution because there isn't anymore.

#### What I learned: 
Matrix problems are supposed to be messy code wise! Every single problem I've had with matrices, the code has been 100 plus lines long.
