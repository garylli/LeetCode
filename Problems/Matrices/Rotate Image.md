#### Thought Process:
46:50.29 We know that this problem requires us to solve the matrix/rotate it 90 degrees **in place**. This means that we woul dhave to only swap or change values of the matrix.
The first way that came to mind was a series of swaps. However, it was hard for me to visualize what a 90 degree rotation would look like exactly.

What ended up helping me the most was drawing out the dots on the original matrix in different colors and forming the resulting matrix using those colors.

#### What I learned: 
Matrices are definitely not one of my strong suites.
