#### Thought Process:
1.3 This problem is just like house robber: you're trying to find the maximum sum of an array with the idea in mind that you cannot pick adjacent houses. This time, however, the
array is circular. Therefore we must be careful about the first, second, and third index.


#### What I learned:
Try to use DP for DP problems :)
