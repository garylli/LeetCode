## Problem Name: Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
### Difficulty: Medium
#### Date Completed: June 29th, 2021.

#### What I learned:
It is much easier to come up with a pattern in your head before starting to code and working from smaller problems up rather than 
jumping immediately into coding. For the past problems I would simply jump straight into the code, leading to further frustrations as 
I began to realize I hadn't fully brushed up on the language. It's easier to get a working algorithm down in your head/on paper 
and simply translating that into code later.
