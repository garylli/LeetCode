## Problem Name: Container with Most Water
### Difficulty: Medium
#### Date Completed: June 28th, 2021.

#### What I learned:
When attempting to come up with an algorithm for a problem, first focus on finding a solution and then optimization. 
Similar to the shitty first draft idea, this helped me get started a lot quicker on this problem, finishing in ~45 minutes rather
than the hours it may have took me if I continued to impose unrealistic runtime expectations on myself. Although it only ran
faster than 68% of the other solutions, it was a much quicker solution and optimizing it further would be easy.

Note to self: Get a solution down. It doesn't matter what the fuck it is, just get one down. Most of the time your solutions are
better than you think.
