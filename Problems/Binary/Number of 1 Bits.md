## Problem Name: Number of 1 Bits
### Difficulty: Easy
#### Date Completed: June 30th, 2021.

#### What I learned:
Easy problems on leetcode are easy. However, this doesn't mean that there are solutions to these problems that I would've never thought of.
With respect to the hamming weight solution, there was a popular solution that I read about n & (n-1) and how that removes the least important one within the number.
I would've never thought of such a solution! 

Reminder to self: Read most upvoted solutions, you'll learn something :)
