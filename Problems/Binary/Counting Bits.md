## Problem Name: Counting Bits
### Difficulty: Easy
#### Date Completed: June 30th, 2021.

#### What I learned:
Another easy problem. I finished in under 10 minutes but it felt like I had a lot more time to think than simply 10 minutes. Proud of myself, kinda of...

If I didn't get a 5th percentile run time complexity that is. My solution for counting bits was correct--I had come up with the optimal solution but due to the terrible 
coding i had used in order to implement my solution, it had brought it downf rom the fastest solution to one of the solution.

Reminder to self in the future: if a solution is too slow, don't throw it away! The solution might be right it just might need some optimizations. :)
