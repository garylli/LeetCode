## Problem Name: Reverse Bits
### Difficulty: Easy
#### Date Completed: June 30th, 2021.

#### What I learned:
This problem was fairly easy, however I almost stopped myself from solving it with the same ideas of my solution being too slow, etc.
I've really got to get rid of that habit of perfectionism on my first attempt as it is doing more harm than good.

Ended up with a 100% solution in less than 10 minutes utilizing simple shifts and the & operator to mask bits.
