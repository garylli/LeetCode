Description: In order to find the dynamic programming solution, it was most helpful for me to first think of what heuristics I needed to track within the traversal of the array.
After a few examples, the products of zeros and negatives jumped out to me as the most notable events. Then, I ran through the arrays with all the possible products listed 
above each index of the array. Using this, I started noticing a pattern where the maximum product was either the most negative value or the inverse of that value.

Thus, we have a DP solution with a running product of sorts tracking the positive values of the array until it encounters a negative value and a negative value that stores said running product.
